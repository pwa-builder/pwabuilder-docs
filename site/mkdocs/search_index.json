Make sure your website meets the \nminimum requirements\n.\n\n\nThe first step is to build the Manifest for your application using the \npwabuilder.com\n web site. The builder will search in the home page of your site looking for information about the app in specific meta tags. For more information, read \nWhat is a Manifest\n.\n\n\nProvide a URL\n\n\n\n\nOpen a browser and navigate to \nhttps://preview.pwabuilder.com\n\n\nClick on the \nGet Started\n button\n\n\n\n\nIn the URL textbox, enter the URL of your site and click on \nGet Started\n again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Manifest\n\n\nThe builder will search in the home page of your site looking for an existing manifest. If not, it will gather information about the app in specific meta tags or propose default values for the manifest properties. It will also show any warnings or suggestions to address potential issues in the collected metadata. Make sure you address any warnings before you move on.\n\n\nNote:\n If your site already has a manifest in place and you are comfortable with the current manifest data, you can skip this step and click on \nNext step\n at the right top of the wizard to jump directly to the \nBuild Service Worker\n step.\n\n\n\n\nAdd Images\n\n\nThe builder site also checks whether the manifest has defined the expected icon sizes for the different platforms (Windows, Android, iOS) and helps to generate the missing sizes. You can also generate missing image sizes for other platforms using the \nPWA Image Generator\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our example, we don't have any image defined in the manifest so we'll proceed uploading an image with our app logo. To do this, click on the \nUpload an image\u2026\n link at the left pane. Browse to the location of the image to upload and, if you want to generate the missing sizes, make sure the \nGenerate missing images from this image\n checkbox is marked.\n\n\nNote:\n Currently, the \nUpload image\n option will only generate the required image sizes for Windows 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n. In our example, the missing image sizes are automatically generated and added to the manifest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Manifest\n\n\nOnce you are done with the updates to the manifest you can download the web app manifest here. Also, you can move on to build a Service Worker and/or Publish your PWA in the next steps.\n\n\nService Workers\n\n\nDuring this step you will choose functionalities you want to add to your app. The builder will include code to use sample service workers implementing those features from a repository. Learn more about service workers \nhere\n.\n\n\nBy default, the builder includes the Offline page service worker to pull a file from your web server called \"offline.html\" and serve the file whenever a network connection cannot be made.\nAdditionally, you can select the Offline copy of pages service worker to keep a cache of all visited pages and serve the stored version in case any fetch fails. Also, the builder can include both features into a combined service worker for a full offline experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the functionalities you want to include in your application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the service worker package including the code for your website and the service worker code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code for your website should be included in your HTML to register the service worker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpload the service worker code JS file to the web site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing\n\n\nPublishing your Progressive Web App is mainly a matter of adding the W3C manifest file and service worker scripts to your website. These assets are then referenced from your website, both with a link tag reference to the manifest file and the service worker registration scripts.\n\n\nWeb\n\n\n\n\nThis is still a web app, so step one is to include these new files into your web site. You can click the \nDownload\n button of the Web section to get the files that you need to add to your site.\n\n\nAdd and upload them to your website. Different browsers will detect your Progressive Web App in different ways, but the \nmanifest\n and \nservice workers\n are required for each of them. \n        \u25cb The Web App Manifest is deployed in your HTML pages using a \nlink\n tag in the head of your document: \n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\">\n.\n        \u25cb Also, add and upload references \nimages\n and \nservice worker\n files to the root path of the site.\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nWindows 10 PWA support is still in Beta, so some features like service workers will not work on all user machines. Your PWA can be created and app listing generated from the below one step publishing button.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nPublish 1-step\n button under the Windows panel\n\n\n\n\nEnter the user name or company name and a valid email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSubmit\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nPublishing directly to the Android Play Store will be coming soon.\n\n\nOther\n\n\nYou can now download polyfill packages to publish both Android and iOS. You'll need Xcode to build and submit your package to the Store.\n\n\n\n\nPolyfills\n\n\nGiven that not every platform or browser runs PWAs yet, the builder provides polyfills for platforms that lack support like \niOS\n, \nMac\n and \nWindows 7\n.\nIn case of Android, PWAs are available through the browser; however, you can generate an \nAndroid\n polyfill app that can be also submitted to the Play store.\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nPublish PWA\n step of the builder wizard, locate the \nAndroid\n section and click the \nDownload\n button. The app package will be generated and downloaded to your local drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, follow the \ninstructions\n to publish your Android app.\n\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nPublish PWA\n step of the builder wizard, locate the \niOS Polyfill\n section and click the \nDownload\n button. The app package will be generated and downloaded to your local drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, follow the \ninstructions\n to publish your iOS app.\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\n\nNot supported on the website.

The builder will search in the home page of your site looking for information about the app in specific meta tags. For more information, read \nWhat is a Manifest\n.\n\n\nManifest\n\n\nThe Manifest for Web Apps is a JSON-based manifest file that provides a centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application (like app name, icons, presentation, etc.), thus solving the problem of having to maintain an heterogeneous set of meta tags and link tags to support each platform. PWAs use this manifest to control the appearance and behavior of the app when it is installed and launched from the user device. For more details see the Web App Manifest Specification.\n\n\nInstall the Tools\n\n\nBefore installing \npwabuilder CLI Tools\n, you must first install \nNode.js\n (version 0.12.0 or later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command:  \n\n\nnpm install pwabuilder -g\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Manifest\n\n\nThe \npwabuilder CLI Tools\n will search in the home page of your site looking for an existing manifest.
