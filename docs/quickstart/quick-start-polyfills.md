# Quick Start Polyfills

Given that not every platform or browser runs PWAs yet, the builder provides polyfills for platforms that lack support like [iOS](../tools/how-to-package-ios.md), [Mac](../tools/how-to-package-mac.md) and [Windows 7](../tools/how-to-package-windows7.md).
In case of Android, PWAs are available through the browser; however, you can generate an [Android](../tools/how-to-package-android.md) polyfill app that can be also submitted to the Play store.
